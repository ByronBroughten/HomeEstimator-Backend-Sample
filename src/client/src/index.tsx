I've been computer programming for awhile now, and after massively underestimating it, managed to make an app. Check it out, eh? And if you know anyone interested in rental property, I would love if they beta test it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGfb8xX2FsI
*/

// I'm making an app for analyzing rental property. These are the main goals:
// 1. Analyze properties faster
// 2. Be as precise as you prefer
// 3. Save and experiment with different combinations of loans and properties
// 4. Allow for custom inputs and outputs (still working on this)
// Right now it's in the beta testing stage. I'm looking for people to try it out, report bugs, and give any and all feedback, really. For beta, everything it can do is free. Most of what it can do will be free in the end.
// Here's a brief video demo:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGfb8xX2FsI
// Here's a link to the app: https://www.ultimatepropertyanalyzer.com/
// If you will try it and provide me with feedback, I would greatly appreciate it. 😊

// - Get numObj editorText to display updated in-entity text. But also, it should keep
//   depreciated in-entity text. So it has to cache.

// - User solverSections in MainSection
// - "getUserData" sometimes returns 401 - unauthorized

// - Make main menu always present. Stylize buttons differently when user isn't logged in.
// - Put userName (or first letter of email) on the right side where sign in/sign up were

// It turns out getting beta users will be difficult after all.
// You don't need the extra features for the below:
// 1. Post it on facebook/insta
// 2. Ask Ed to have a look at it
// 3. Maybe attend an RE meetup or two

// Last steps to Ultimate Property Analyzer
// 1. are saved isn't working right with entities
// - to find the difference, use zod

// 3. Bring back custom outputs/output lists
//   1. Make the lists be the same as regular varb lists, but green
//      - This is kind of nice, because then the outputs can be defined
//        just like varbs
//   2. Make the lists be like they are displayed now
//     - I'll need a way to add varbs to the output list
//       in real time and save it. It would be most intuitive to just
//       make the output lists look similar, perhaps just stacked instead
//       of on their side

// Analyzer output list:
// - Add a title
// - Add a button to add new outputs
// - Add a way to remove outputs
// - Menu for saving and loading output lists
// Menu output list:
// - Same as Analyzer output list, but stacked items

// 3.5 Allow custom variables on property, loan, and mgmt
// - add a list called "variables", which contains labeled equation items
// - add and remove those beneath the basic variables.
// - this way, properties and deals can be totally customized.

// 4. Bring back deal compare
// - Generate the table from the db every time
//    - implement property compare, etc
// Cherries on top
// 5. Api variables
// 6. Sharing things with other users
// - Send a sharing invite to another user based on their email
// - If they accept, you can grant them readonly or edit access
//   to whatever they'd like
//   - This would obviously work best if I can get websockets going

// 1. When a subscription is active (or inactive), getUserData and updateSubscription
//    should return the subscription header like they're supposed to
//    - This will require parsing the json
//    - You will want to borrow from the stripe webhook

// 2. Think about fixing the css register bug
// - A session is created after register but before email verification
// - Maybe I could use the post-email-verification feature that I could use
//   to create the new user

// Launch the app.
// - Post it, asking people for input
//   *Reddit
//    - r/realestateinvesting
//    - r/realestate
//    - r/landlords
//    - answer people's questions about how to size up properties
//    - Reddit ads
//   *Podcast ads
//    - Optimal finance daily
//   *Quora
//    - answer people's questions about how to analyze property
//   * Youtube ads
//   * Facebook ads
//    - banner
// - Post on the bigger pockets forum
// - Get an "influencer" to showcase it?

// - Think about the race condition on the front-end for someone starting
//   a subscription. This might not be a problem.
//   - The FE waits one second
//   - The FE sends the request to update its subscription
//   - the subscription is not yet there—there is no subscription
//     that was made recently, or no subscription that has never been
//     obtained by the front end

// - Maybe implement social login
// - Maybe disable getUserData on the backend unless
//   the email has been verified

// - Do I want to use the same variable names for the dropdown as I do for the ones in the equations? Yes, I think I do. At least for display purposes.
// - Ah, but that wouldn't differentiate userVarb sections.
// - I would need a way to differentiate those, too.
// 1. Perhaps it can optionally show the sectionName in bold above the entity.
//    If the sectionName is too long, though, that doesn't work
// 2. Optionally add the sectionName to the front of the variable.
//    This is an ok solution. Perhaps if you click the entity it does this.
// 3. Add a small menu to the entities. It shows the sectionName, and some options

// Possible quick tutorials:
// Overview
// Analyze deals
// Reduce data entry
// - Reusing properties for different scenarios
// - Custom variables
// - Custom lists
// - api variables?
// Suit your needs
// - Custom variables
// - Custom outputs
// Compare deals

// Possible roadmap
// - Roadmap
// - Custom variables
// - Custom lists
// - Network effect
//   - Link with other accounts
//   - Share variables, lists, properties, etc
//   - Forum, or a reddit thread or discord
//     This would be too much I think

// It would be good to break up theme
// themeBtn.ts
// theme.btn.
// etc.

// You probably want example lists and variables.

// Be more like Google—put the menu on the left side.
// I could make the lists be "advanced"
